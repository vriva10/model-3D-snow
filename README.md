https://vriva10.github.io/model-3D-snow/

This model, coded on Spyder in Python, simulates the melting of a given volume of snow in a given terrain. Inputs are a shapefile of a snow mass and a DEM. The script then integrates the creation of the snow volume from the shapefile, based on the physical characteristics of the snow, and then integrates a vertical and horizontal regression of the volume, taking into account the effect of slope and wind.
This model is in its infancy, and recommendations are welcome. I'm not a professional, so this project is a sidequest to my geomatics research on seasonal snow cover.
